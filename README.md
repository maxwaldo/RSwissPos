# RSwissPos
R package to get data on Swiss direct democratic ballots. 

The package also provides posterior estimates of ballot discrimination based on Bayesian Item Response Theory models (static or dynamic) to compute the position of the five main Swiss parties over-time. The exemple for the "getPosResDD" and for the "getPostEstDD" functions show how to measure the positions of Swiss municipalities on the party competition space as presented in Walder (2025).

If you use this measurement please cite: Walder (2025)

To install the package, run: 

```{r}
devtools::install_github('maxwaldo/RSwissPos')
```
